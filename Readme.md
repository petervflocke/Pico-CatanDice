# An overengineered Catan Dice pretending to be speaking slot machine

Just to check out what Raspberry Pi Pico can, I created this random generator.

## Main features

- Generating two random numbers from 1 to 6. The randomness is based on some none deterministic factors such as:

    - shifting an internal register
    - random time between button pressed
    - value of a two floating ADC inputs

- Dynamicly animate generating the numbers. Here pretend to be a slot machine with some simple sound efects

- Speak out result

- Show statistics from this game and all prevoius saved on a sd-card


## Miscelenius  

- Check 3D folder for enclousure

- Check docs & wiring folder for schematics and some pictures from DIY

- BOM:

    - RPI Pico
    - LCD 1.8" with SD card slot
    - Phone mini loudspeaker 
    - Rotary Encoder
    - few resistors, capcitors



... Some further details in preperation or on a request.
